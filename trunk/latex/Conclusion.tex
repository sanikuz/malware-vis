Malware network traces are important characteristics of a malware sample's behavior. To address the need of a visual representation in the workplace of malware analysis, we have develop a processing and visualization tool, MalwareVis, that allow a security analyst to filter, select, visualize, and compare malware network traces. It reads pcap files, processes them into streams and generates cell views for the user-selected malware entities interactively. In this paper, we have described our visualization design and demonstrate the advantages of using cell views. In the future, we will explore several areas such as visualizing the relationship among a collection of malware network traces.
