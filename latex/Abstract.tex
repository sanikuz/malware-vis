This paper presents MalwareVis, a utility that provides security researchers a method to browse, filter, view and compare malware network traces as entities.

Specifically, we propose a cell-like visualization model to view the network traces of a malware sample's execution. This model is a intuitive representation of the heterogeneous attributes (protocol, host ip, transmission size, packet number, duration) of a list of network streams associated with a malware instance. We encode these features into colors and basic geometric properties of common shapes. The list of streams is organized circularly in a clock-wise fashion to form an entity. Our design takes into account of the sparse and skew nature of these attributes' distributions and proposes mapping and layout strategies to allow a clear global view of a malware sample's behaviors. 

We demonstrate MalwareVis on a real-world corpus of malware samples and display their individual activity patterns. We show that it is a simple to use utility that provides intriguing visual representations that facilitate user interaction to perform security analysis.
